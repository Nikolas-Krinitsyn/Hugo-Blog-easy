> ‚ÄúPut on salvation as your helmet, and take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.‚Äù - Eph 6:17 ESV

Many people understand the word of God is the Sword of the spirit but that's just where their understanding ends. My goal is to show you how the word of God should work in our lives and some practical ways to use it.

## How does a sword work?

A sword is a weapon that had existed all through out history. It's a weapon designed primarily for attack but it can also at times be used defensively too. But here I will highlight the attack purpose of a sword since this is what it will do 90% of the time.

But how can we use the word of God as a sword? Below I will list some areas in our life we can effectively use Gods word.

1. We can use it against temptations (Matthew 4)
2. We can use it to win souls for Christ (Acts 8)
3. We can train with it to sharpen our own skills and edify our own lives (Psalms 119:147-148)

### 1. We can use it against temptations

In the book of Matthew right after Jesus‚Äôs baptism he is in the wilderness (ch 4) and in the wilderness he encounters temptations. Instead of trying to ignore these temptations Jesus uses Gods word to combat them. Gods word Is truth and when we declare truth no lie of the enemy will be able to deceive us. If we try using our own strength against temptation it will be much more difficult but if we lean on Gods word we are building a foundation on truth and it will withstand the lies of the enemy (Matthew 7).

### 2. We can use it to win souls for Christ

In Acts chapter 8 Philip was traveling and he ran into the treasurer of Ethiopia riding on a carriage and reading from the scrolls of Isaiah. Using this oportunty Philip explained the scripture to him and was able to reveal Jesus Christ in scrolls written many years ago. This is a wonderful example of how old testament scripture all points to Jesus and in our own lives we don‚Äôt just have Old Testament scripture but we also have New Testament with the words of Jesus! When we realize the power in Gods word we can effectively use it to minister not only to believers but also to the lost. Gods word is powerful and using it to bring other to Christ is something we have no excuse not to do.

### 3. We can train with it to sharpen our own skills and edify our own lives

Like any weapon a trained person is always more deadly than someone who picks up a weapon for the first time. Likewise a Christian we should be effective in using the word of God. I will highlight something here that is very controversial. Christians should not be leaving their homes without a Bible.

The main argument for Christians not to carry their bible is that ‚Äúthey have it in their heart‚Äù. This is absolutely ridiculous. How many bible verses do you really have memorized???

5 verses from the bible is only 0.016% percent of Gods word!!

And If you managed to memorize 1% that would only equal 311 verses ü§Ø

The reality is that you will never be able to memorize 100% of everything in the Bible. We should always carry Gods word with us and I highly recommend having a mini bible to put in your car or purse. Having a physical bible offers a great opportunity for you to share the Bible when you evangelize to an individual. Imagine testifying to a man at a cafe and handing him your bible. This man you encounter will never forget that conversation because you gave him YOUR bible! It will leave an impact for him that he will never forget. This shouldn't be your only reason for carrying a bible but its definatly a big bonus.
